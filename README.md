## Overview

Physical therapy adherence remains a major challenge, with many patients failing to complete prescribed recovery plans. RecoveryLab addresses this by combining computer vision, language models, and real-time communication tools to deliver structured feedback, adaptive programming, and longitudinal recovery tracking in a single web platform.
